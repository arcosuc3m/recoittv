### What is this repository for? ###
We present a new Surface-Constrained Total Variation based (SCTV) method for CBCT based on the Split Bregman algorithm. It takes advantage of the surface information of the sample as an imposed constraint to help in the recovery of the contour of the sample and in the definition of the other edges and details.
We provide binaries of the application that implements the SCBT method. 


Current Version is 1.3.10.
