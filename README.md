### What is this repository for? ###
We present a new Surface-Constrained Total Variation based (SCTV) method for CBCT based on the Split Bregman algorithm. It takes advantage of the surface information of the sample as an imposed constraint to help in the recovery of the contour of the sample and in the definition of the other edges and details.
We provide binaries of a command-line application that implements the SCBT method. 


Current Version is 1.3.10. 


### Minimum Requirements ###

#### Hardware #####

* One NVidia GPU with CUDA support (preferably series 6 or superior).
* 20 GB RAM (512^3 cubic volume reconstruction).

#### Software ####

* Linux system (Recommended: Ubuntu 14.04 or higher) or Windows system  (7 or higher)
* NVidia CUDA 7.0 or higher
* OpenMP 

### Set up ###

We provide the binaries for our application. You can install the files as they are in any folder in which you have execution permissions. 
Since it is a command line application it is necessary to use a command shell. 

* In the case of Windows we recommend the usage of PowerShell
* In the case of Linux System ypou can use your preferred shell.
